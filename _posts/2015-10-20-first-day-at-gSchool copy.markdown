Day 1 Week 1 of Galvanize's Full Stack Developer program or gSchool. Located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, Galvanize is one of the many developer bootcamps that have popped up in the past few years.

I landed at Galvanize after speanding months researching the available full stack bootcamps in the Bay Area -- Hack Reactor, MakerSquare, Dev Bootcamp, etc.

Based in Colorado, Galvanize opened up shop in downtown San Francisco about a year ago. They have campuses in Boulder, Denver (x2), Fort Collins, San Francisco, Seattle, and they are launching a new campus in Austin.

Galvanize's curriculum covers html&css, Javascript, Node & Express, and Ruby on Rails. It is based on the popular MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Anjular, and Node).
