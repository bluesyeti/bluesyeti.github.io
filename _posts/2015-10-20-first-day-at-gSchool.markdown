Day 1 Week 1 of Galvanize's Full Stack Developer program or gSchool. Located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, Galvanize is one of the many developer bootcamps that have popped up in the past few years.

I landed at Galvanize after speanding months researching the available full stack bootcamps in the Bay Area -- Hack Reactor, MakerSquare, Dev Bootcamp, etc.
At first my top choice was Hack Reactor (I still think it is one of the best bootcamps around).

Based in Colorado, Galvanize opened up shop in downtown San Francisco about a year ago. They have campuses in Boulder, Denver (x2), Fort Collins, San Francisco, Seattle, and they are launching a new campus in Austin.

While many of the bootcamps I looked at last about 12 weeks or 3 months, Galvanize lasts for 24 weeks or 6 months. Unlike Hack Reactor's vigorous 12 hour a day 6 days a week schedule, Galvanize operates 9am-5pm 5 days a week (although I have been told that many people stay much longer than 5pm to continuing working--including some of the instructors). For me, this was important. I knew that whatever program I decided on, it was going to be a challenge and stressful. Having only one day a week to 'come down' from the stress and catch up on work seemed to be  

Galvanize's curriculum covers html&css, Javascript, Node & Express, and Ruby on Rails. It is based on the popular MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Anjular, and Node).
