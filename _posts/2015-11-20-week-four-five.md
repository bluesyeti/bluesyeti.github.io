Week 4 & 5 wrapped up the frontend portion of our Galvanize fullstack program. I will have some followup posts to talk in detail about some of the subjects that I ouline in this post. 

##Week 4:
Week 4 added essential tools to our frontend dev quiver. 

###Forms
We started the week off by dissecting HTML forms and incorporating validation techniques. As future web developers it is very easy to imagine spending an obscene amount of time working on HTML forms and form validation -- since 9/10 times user information is collect via a form.

###Networking: 
Inching closer and closer to our next section -- the backend -- we went over the basics of understanding the web on a deeper (albeit relatively shallow) level. The goal was to understand the networking processes from the time a user typed in a website domain to having the browser display the webpage. I go into slightly more detain in my post about [How the Internet Works](http://galvanizefullstack.com/networks/internet/learning/2015/11/10/the-internet.html).

###AJAX
AJAX is short for **asynchronous Javascript and XML**. AJAX uses an asynchronous processing model. This means that the user or browser can do other things while the browser is waiting for data to load -- improving the user experience. When a browser encounters a `<script>` tag, generally it will stop processing the page until the script has been loaded. This is call **synchronous Javascript and XML.

###APIs
###Local Storage
###Deployment with Github Pages
